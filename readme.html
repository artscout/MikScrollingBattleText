		<div class="SectionBody">
			The trigger system is a powerful and flexible system that allows you to specify custom events to be displayed based on
			specific game events that are not already handled by default. There are several mechanisms in place to ensure triggers are efficient as
			possible so they are not needlessly wasting CPU cycles checking conditions that aren't relevant. Due to this optimization, several common
			triggers are included by default.
			<div class="SubsectionTitle"><a name="TriggerBasicConcepts"></a>Basic Concepts:</div>
			<div class="SubsectionBody">
				Every time almost anything happens in the game, a combat log entry is generated for it. While it is not readily visible, each of these
				combat log entries is categorized by Blizzard according to specific event types. It is these event types that drive triggers. Triggers are
				really just definitions of a specific set of circumstances that must occur before they will fire.
				<br /><br />
				Aside from being categorized into an event type, each event that occurs in game has several other pieces of information associated with it such as
				who the source of the event was, how much the event hit or healed for, and whether or not the event was a crit. Obviously this additional information
				varies according to the type of event it is since, for example, an aura application can't crit.
				<br /><br />
				The trigger system refers to these event types as <a href="#MainEvents">main events</a> and the additional pieces of information as
				<a href="#MainEventConditions">conditions</a>, since ultimately it is these additional pieces of information that define the specific
				circumstances of interest.
				<br /><br />
				Let's consider an example event to better understand how the pieces fit together. Assume that you were just hit by a fireball. The damage caused
				to you by the fireball generated an event of type "Skill Damage". The event also has many of other pieces of information associated with it like
				the name of the unit who cast the fireball, how much the fireball hit you for, whether or not it crit, whether the unit who cast the fireball is a
				player or an NPC, etc.
				<br /><br />
				Putting the above fireball example in terms of the trigger system, the fireball hitting you was a <a href="#MainEvents">main event</a> of type
				"Skill Damage", and the <a href="#MainEventConditions">conditions</a> were the name of the unit who cast the fireball, how much it hit you for, and so on.
				<br /><br />
				While the <a href="#MainEvents">main events</a> and their <a href="#MainEventConditions">conditions</a> offer a wealth the information, there is other non-event
				related "state" information available such as the current zone your character is in, whether or not certain buffs are active, and whether or not certain skills are
				available. This "state" information forms the basis for what the trigger system refers to as <a href="#TriggerExceptions">exceptions</a>. An
				<a href="#TriggerExceptions">exception</a> will prevent a trigger from being displayed when it applies.
			</div>

			<div class="SubsectionTitle"><a name="TriggerMechanics"></a>Trigger Mechanics:</div>
			<div class="SubsectionBody">
				Now that it is clear what <a href="#MainEvents">main events</a>, <a href="#MainEventConditions">conditions</a>, and <a href="#TriggerExceptions">exceptions</a>
				are, we can explore how triggers make use of them and consequently how they are defined.
				<br /><br />
				The following list summarizes the stages a trigger follows to determine whether or not it fires:
				<ol>
					<li>One of the <a href="#MainEvents">main events</a> that a trigger has defined occurs.</li>
					<li>
						The specific <a href="#MainEventConditions">conditions</a> defined for the <a href="#MainEvents">main event</a> for the trigger are tested. If any of the
						conditions do not apply, the trigger will not fire and all processing for the trigger stops.
					</li>
					<li>
						The <a href="#TriggerExceptions">exceptions</a> defined for the trigger are tested. If any of the exceptions apply, the trigger will not fire and all
						processing for the trigger stops.
					</li>
					<li>The trigger fires thus displaying the specified output message and event settings.</li>
				</ol>
				<br />
				As mentioned in the "<a href="#TriggerBasicConcepts">Basic Concepts</a>" section above, triggers are driven by <a href="#MainEvents">main events</a>.
				Each trigger can be based on one or more of these <a href="#MainEvents">main events</a> each with unique <a href="#MainEventConditions">conditions</a>.
				These <a href="#MainEvents">main events</a> are treated as an "or" relationship meaning that when <b>ANY</b> one of them occurs, the trigger will move to the next
				stage of testing the <a href="#MainEventConditions">conditions</a>.
				<br /><br />
				The <a href="#MainEventConditions">conditions</a> defined for a given <a href="#MainEvents">main event</a> are treated as an "and" relationship meaning that
				<b>ALL</b> of them must be true for the trigger to move to the next stage of testing <a href="#TriggerExceptions">exceptions</a>.
				<br /><br />
				During the final stage, the <a href="#TriggerExceptions">exceptions</a> defined for a trigger are treated as an "or" relationship meaning that when <b>ANY</b> one
				of them is true, the trigger will not fire.
			</div>

			<div class="SubsectionTitle"><a name="TriggerAdvancedConcepts"></a>Advanced Concepts:</div>
			<div class="SubsectionBody">
				Most common triggers won't need to delve into any of the concepts presented in this section, but using some of the more advanced capabilities
				can lead to triggers for highly complex events or single triggers capable of handling multiple events.
				<br /><br />
				Here is an overview of the main points that will be covered:
				<ul>
					<li>Each <a href="#MainEvents">main event</a> can be used multiple times for a single trigger</li>
					<li>Each <a href="#MainEventConditions">condition</a> can be used multiple times for a given <a href="#MainEvents">main event</a>.</li>
					<li>Triggers will try to choose an appropriate icon based on the <a href="#MainEvents">main event</a> that fired it.</li>
					<li>Substitution codes for skill names are available.</li>
					<li>Skill IDs can be used to discern which rank of a skill was used.</li>
				</ul>
				<br />
				Recall from the "<a href="#TriggerMechanics">Trigger Mechanics</a>" section that each trigger can have multiple <a href="#MainEvents">main events</a> treated
				as an "or" relationship, and that each <a href="#MainEvents">main event</a> can have its own unique <a href="#MainEventConditions">conditions</a>. Combining that
				with the capability to use a <a href="#MainEvents">main event</a> multiple times for a single trigger means you can effectively cover a set of common
				scenarios all with a single trigger. For example, imagine you want to see when both Mace Stun and Improved Hamstring proc. Both cases are an aura application,
				but they have different skill names. By adding the same <a href="#MainEvents">main event</a> twice, but specifying a different skill name
				<a href="#MainEventConditions">condition</a> for each one, you are effectively saying when Mace Stun or Improved Hamstring proc this trigger should fire. Naturally
				the other <a href="#MainEventConditions">conditions</a> such as affiliation and reaction would need to also be set for each event.
				<br /><br />
				The astute reader will say "Wait a second! How will I be able to tell which one procced if the output message is the same?". This problem is solved with substitution
				codes. Depending on which event actually caused the trigger to fire, %s will be replaced the appropriate skill name. Also, the correct icon would be displayed since
				triggers attempt to choose an appropriate icon based on the <a href="#MainEvents">main event</a> that fired them.
				<br /><br />
				The capability of using the same condition multiple times for a given <a href="#MainEvents">main event</a> with different relationships means that things such as ranges
				and complex pattern matching can be implemented. For example, imagine you are trying to create a trigger that will fire when an amount is between two values. The first
				<a href="#MainEventConditions">condition</a> could be "Amount - Is Greater Than - X" and the second could be "Amount - Is Less Than - Y".
				<br /><br />
				Another advanced capability is using skill IDs to detect when specific ranks, such as rank 1, are being used. Most online databases can be used to ascertain
				what the skill ID is for the ranks of each skill. By adding <a href="#MainEventConditions">conditions</a> that specify these specific skill IDs, it is possible
				to only trigger on specific skill ranks.
			</div>

			<div class="SubsectionTitle"><a name="ExampleTriggers"></a>Example Triggers:</div>
			<div class="SubsectionBody">
				Since the point of the trigger system is to allow for custom events that are not already available, there is no way to cover all of the possibilities.
				However, most commonly requested triggers fall within the following categories. An example trigger or two for each category is provided and can be
				used as a guide to creating your desired trigger.
				<br /><br />
				Please note these examples don't make use of advanced capabilities in order to keep the examples easy to
				understand.

			Here is the official lua reference for patterns:
			<div class="SubsectionTitle">Character Class:</div>
			<div class="SubsectionBody">
				A <i>character class</i> is used to represent a set of characters. The following combinations are allowed in describing a character class:
				<ul>
					<li>x: (where x is not one of the magic characters ^$()%.[]*+-?) represents the character x itself.</li>
					<li>.: (a dot) represents all characters.</li>
					<li>%a: represents all letters.</li>
					<li>%c: represents all control characters.</li>
					<li>%d: represents all digits.</li>
					<li>%l: represents all lowercase letters.</li>
					<li>%p: represents all punctuation characters.</li>
					<li>%s: represents all space characters.</li>
					<li>%u: represents all uppercase letters.</li>
					<li>%w: represents all alphanumeric characters.</li>
					<li>%x: represents all hexadecimal digits.</li>
					<li>%z: represents the character with representation 0.</li>
					<li>
						%x: (where x is any non-alphanumeric character) represents the character x. This is the standard way to escape the magic characters. Any punctuation character (even the non magic)
						can be preceded by a '%' when used to represent itself in a pattern.
					</li>
					<li>
						[set]: represents the class which is the union of all characters in set. A range of characters may be specified by separating the end characters of the range with a '-'. All classes
						%x described above may also be used as components in set. All other characters in set represent themselves. For example, [%w_] (or [_%w]) represents all alphanumeric characters plus
						the underscore, [0-7] represents the octal digits, and [0-7%l%-] represents the octal digits plus the lowercase letters plus the '-' character.
						<br /><br />
						The interaction between ranges and classes is not defined. Therefore, patterns like [%a-z] or [a-%%] have no meaning.
					</li>
					<br />
					<li>[^set]: represents the complement of set, where set is interpreted as above.</li>
				</ul>
				For all classes represented by single letters (%a, %c, etc.), the corresponding uppercase letter represents the complement of the class. For instance, %S represents all non-space characters.
				<br /><br />
				The definitions of letter, space, and other character groups depend on the current locale. In particular, the class [a-z] may not be equivalent to %l.
			</div>


			<div class="SubsectionTitle">Pattern Item:</div>
			<div class="SubsectionBody">
				A pattern item may be:
				<ul>
					<li>a single character class, which matches any single character in the class;</li>

					<li>a single character class followed by '*', which matches 0 or more repetitions of characters in the class. These repetition items will always match the longest possible sequence;</li>
					<li>a single character class followed by '+', which matches 1 or more repetitions of characters in the class. These repetition items will always match the longest possible sequence;</li>
					<li>a single character class followed by '-', which also matches 0 or more repetitions of characters in the class. Unlike '*', these repetition items will always match the shortest possible sequence;</li>
					<li>a single character class followed by '?', which matches 0 or 1 occurrence of a character in the class;</li>
					<li>%n, for n between 1 and 9; such item matches a substring equal to the n-th captured string (see below);</li>
					<li>

						%bxy, where x and y are two distinct characters; such item matches strings that start with x, end with y, and where the x and y are balanced. This means that, if one reads the string from left to right,
						counting +1 for an x and -1 for a y, the ending y is the first y where the count reaches 0. For instance, the item %b() matches expressions with balanced parentheses.
					</li>
				</ul>
			</div>


			<div class="SubsectionTitle">Pattern:</div>
			<div class="SubsectionBody">
				A <i>pattern</i> is a sequence of pattern items. A '^' at the beginning of a pattern anchors the match at the beginning of the subject string. A '$' at the end of a pattern anchors the match at the end of the subject string.
				At other positions, '^' and '$' have no special meaning and represent themselves.
			</div>


			<div class="SubsectionTitle">Captures:</div>
			<div class="SubsectionBody">
				A pattern may contain sub-patterns enclosed in parentheses; they describe captures. When a match succeeds, the substrings of the subject string that match captures are stored (captured) for future use. Captures are numbered
				according to their left parentheses. For instance, in the pattern "(a*(.)%w(%s*))", the part of the string matching "a*(.)%w(%s*)" is stored as the first capture (and therefore has number 1); the character matching "." is
				captured with number 2, and the part matching "%s*" has number 3.
				<br /><br />

				As a special case, the empty capture () captures the current string position (a number). For instance, if we apply the pattern "()aa()" on the string "flaaap", there will be two captures: 3 and 5.

					<a name="FAQFonts"></a><b>I don't like any of the fonts supplied with MSBT. How do I use my own fonts?</b>
					<br /><br />

					<div style="color: red;">
						WARNING: FONT FILES MUST EXIST IN THE TARGET LOCATION <b>BEFORE</b> WORLD OF WARCRAFT IS STARTED.<br />
						IT IS HIGHLY RECOMMENDED THAT YOU PLACE YOUR CUSTOM FONT FILES IN THE MikScrollingBattleText\Fonts DIRECTORY TO AVOID ISSUES.
					</div>
					<br /><br />

					NOTE: Keep in mind that if you use your own font files that you need to make sure the font
					supports the characters that will be displayed. For example the typical way to display buff
					gains is [BuffName]. If the font you use does not have a character glyph for the [ or ]
					characters you will not be able to see the unsupported characters. This is especially important
					with non-English clients since a lot of characters aren't supported by English fonts.
					<br /><br />

					There are a couple of ways to use custom fonts:
					<br /><br />
					<ul>
						<li>
							The first, and preferred method, is to use MSBT's new in-game media editor available under the custom media tab. If you follow
							the recommended guideline of placing your custom font files in the MikScrollingBattleText\Fonts directory, all you need to enter
							for the font path in the in-game media editor is the name of the font file.
							<br /><br />

							For example, assume you have a truetype font file "MyUberFont.ttf" you want to use.
							<br /><br />
							<ol type="a">
								<li>Copy the "MyUberFont.ttf" font file into the MikScrollingBattleText\Fonts directory before you start the game.</li>
								<li>Load the game and access MSBT's custom media tab.</li>
								<li>Click the Add Font button.</li>
								<li>Enter the name you want the font to be called in game such as "My Custom Font" without the quotes.</li>
								<li>Enter "MyUberFont.ttf" without the quotes for the font path.</li>
								<li>Click the Okay button and the new font will be available.</li>
							</ol>
						</li>
						<br /><br />
						<li>
							The second method is aimed more at mod developers that want to display information using MSBT. You can call the MikSBT.RegisterFont
							function to register a custom font that you may then specify in your call to MikSBT.DisplayMessage. See the included API.html file
							for reference information.
						</li>
					</ul>
				</li>

				<li class="FAQListItem">
					<a name="FAQFontSize"></a><b>How do I increase the font size to something larger than 38?</b>
					<br /><br />
					It is not currently possible due to a limitation within the game. Blizzard has stated that allowing larger font sizes is something they
					would like to implement at some point, but has not provided a time frame.
				</li>

				<li class="FAQListItem">
					<a name="FAQSounds"></a><b>How do I add my own custom sounds?</b>

						IT IS HIGHLY RECOMMENDED THAT YOU PLACE YOUR CUSTOM SOUND FILES IN THE MikScrollingBattleText\Sounds DIRECTORY TO AVOID ISSUES.
					</div>
					<br /><br />

					There are a couple of methods that can be used to add custom sounds.
					<ul>
						<li>
							The first, and preferred method, is to use MSBT's new in-game media editor available under the custom media tab. If you follow
							the recommended guideline of placing your custom sound files in the MikScrollingBattleText\Sounds directory, all you need to enter
							for the sound path in the in-game media editor is the name of the sound file. The acceptable sound file types are .mp3 and .ogg.
							<br /><br />

							For example, assume you have an mp3 sound file "MyUberSound.mp3" you want to use.
							<br /><br />
							<ol type="a">
								<li>Copy the "MyUberSound.mp3" sound file into the MikScrollingBattleText\Sounds directory before you start the game.</li>
								<li>Load the game and access MSBT's custom media tab.</li>
								<li>Click the Add Sound button.</li>
								<li>Enter the name you want the sound to be called in game such as "My Custom Sound" without the quotes.</li>
								<li>Enter "MyUberSound.mp3" without the quotes for the sound path.</li>
								<li>Click the Okay button and the new sound will be available.</li>

					<a name="FAQNewTrigger"></a><b>How do I create a new trigger?</b>
					<br /><br />
					The first step is to <b>read</b> the <a href="#TriggerGuide">Trigger Guide</a> and <a href="#TriggerReference">Trigger Reference</a> sections above.
					<br /><br />
					Among other things, the guide explains how triggers work, what the various components of the trigger system are, and provides example triggers for
					common categories. The reference section provides specific information about the various components such as the available substitution codes, main
					events, conditions, and exceptions.
					<br /><br />
					Once you've read those sections, we can continue on to the process for creating triggers.
					<br /><br />
					We will be creating a trigger that notifies us when Polymorph breaks from a hostile unit when we are playing on a mage in the arena.
					<br /><br />
					<ol type="a">
						<li>Since a new trigger is being created, click the Add New Trigger button, enter "Poly Broke - %r!" for the output message, and click Okay.</li>
						<li>
							The trigger conditions configuration dialog for the new trigger will automatically be shown. You can click the trigger conditions icon
							button (the gear) next to a trigger to access these settings manually at a later time.
						</li>
						<li>
							Click the edit Trigger Classes icon button and uncheck "All" classes. Check Mage for the class the trigger will apply to.
							It is better to select the specific classes the trigger applies to instead of selecting all classes since by specifying
							classes, the mod can completely ignore the trigger and save resources for the classes to which it does not apply.
						</li>
						<li>Click the Add Event button next to the Main Events label to add a new main event.</li>
						<li>Select Aura Removal for the Main Event.</li>
						<li>Modify the first condition to "Recipient Unit Reaction - Is Equal To - Hostile" because we don't want to see when poly fades from our teammates.</li>

					The %r used in step a is a substitution code for the name of the unit that the debuff (polymorph in this case) faded from.
					You already knew that though because you read the <a href="#TriggerGuide">Trigger Guide</a> and <a href="#TriggerReference">Trigger Reference</a>!
					<br /><br />
					The color, font settings, sticky state, sound, and output scroll area for the trigger can be set like any other event.

				<li class="FAQListItem">
					<a name="FAQMutilate"></a><b>Is it possible to prevent Mutilate from being merged?</b>
					<br /><br />
					Yes. Add it to the merge exclusions list under the Spam Controls tab in the options interface.
				</li>

				<li class="FAQListItem">
					<a name="FAQXP"></a><b>Is is possible to disable the default Blizzard XP Text?</b>
					<br /><br />
					No. Unfortunately that text is not a part of the UI and Blizzard has not provided the means necessary to disable it. I have requested a CVar to
					control it several times over the years, but they have yet to add one.
				</li>

				<li class="FAQListItem">
					<a name="FAQVE"></a><b>How do I suppress Vampiric Embrace?</b>
					<br /><br />
					This can be accomplished a couple of different ways.
					<br /><br />

					<ul>
						<li>The preferred method is to add it to the skill suppressions list under the Spam Controls tab.</li>
						<br /><br />
						<li>
							Another way is to use the heal threshold slider under the Spam Controls tab.<br />
							The drawback to this approach is that all heals under the specified value will be suppressed and not
							specifically Vampiric Embrace, which may or may not be your desired behavior.
						</li>
					</ul>
				</li>

				<li class="FAQListItem">
					<a name="FAQExclusiveIcons"></a><b>I want to see skill names even when there is an icon. Is that possible?</b>
					<br /><br />
					Yes. Uncheck "Exclusive Skill Names" under the Skill Icons tab.
				</li>

				<li class="FAQListItem">
					<a name="FAQGameDamage"></a><b>Is there a way to show the damage above the target's heads like the default damage text?</b>
					<br /><br />
					The only way this is possible is using the built-in game damage. It can be enabled through the game's interface options, but keep
					in mind you will lose all customization capabilities for outgoing damage if you choose to use the game's built-in damage.
					WoW's API does not provide a method to get the position of 3D game objects such as players and mobs. This is intentional on their
					part and will likely never change.
					<br /><br />
					I do not recommend using the built-in game damage option. If you take the time to get used to having the damage in a consolidated area,
					you will likely find it superior in many ways. Aside from the obvious visual customization capabilities of using MSBT's damage display,
					there are many other benefits such as being able to see the damage and healing being done to targets that are not in your viewport, merging
					of AoE with cumulative amounts, throttling of DoT spam, damage thresholds, per skill suppressions for things you don't care about, icons
					annotating which skill caused the damage or healing, and more.
				</li>

				<li class="FAQListItem">
					<a name="FAQEfficiency"></a><b>Is MSBT efficient?</b>
					<br /><br />
					Absolutely. MSBT 5.0 was completely re-designed from the ground up using Blizzard's new mod statistics
					API tools with the #1 priority of optimization for reduced memory usage and CPU efficiency. As a result,
					it is both lightweight (low memory usage) and efficient (low CPU usage), which, sadly, is frequently ignored
					in performance discussions. Performance entails both memory usage and CPU usage. Unless you don't have enough
					RAM available, CPU usage is almost always more of a factor on your FPS than raw memory usage is.
					<br /><br />
					Please don't just take my word for it though. Test it out for yourself. Blizzard has made it simple to see
					statistics about mod usage with the GetAddOnMemoryUsage and GetAddOnCPUUsage API calls. Testing a mod will
					give you a true picture of its performance.
					<br /><br />

					One thing to keep in mind during your testing is that MSBT is written to be completely dynamic. It will only create exactly what
					objects it needs when it needs them and then reuse them from that point forward. This means during the first few combat cycles
					you will see a slightly higher increasing rate than you might expect as the first set of objects is created. The rate will quickly
					stabilize to typically less than 1 KiB/s as the objects begin to be reused. The main benefits to this approach are less overall memory
					usage and very little memory churn.
					<br /><br />

					Also, don't forget to look at CPU utilization. As I said above, it is frequently ignored, but it is also important. Would you
					rather have your CPU spending extra time on the game engine, or wasting cycles on an inefficient mod?

						<ul>
							<li>Complete code rewrite for even better performance and features.</li>
							<li>
								Major Optimizations:
								<ul>
									<li>
										Rewrote the combat parsing engine to significantly increase performance and lower the memory footprint.
									</li>
									<li>
										Redesigned the suppression system to use a hash table searching algorithm so that any number of suppressions may be added without any appreciable slowdown.
									</li>
									<li>
										Optimized the default profile handling. Due to the large number of options, the default
										profile table takes up a decent chunk of memory (around 90 KiB). In the previous versions, the
										table was always memory resident - even when it wasn't needed. It is now created dynamically
										only when it's needed, which is the first time you load a new version of the mod or reset a profile
										to its defaults.
									</li>
									<li>
										Redesigned the underlying options tables such that shared information amongst the events is
										only stored once instead of separately for each event. This saves quite a bit of memory,
										especially when there are multiple profiles.
									</li>
									<li>
										Created a single pool of dynamically created font strings to be shared by the various scroll areas.
										Previously a set number of font strings were created for every scroll area.
									</li>
									<li>Load up memory usage is now around 450 KiB.</li>
								</ul>
							</li>
							<br />

							<li>
								Minor Optimizations:
								<ul>
									<li>
										Trigger system will no longer listen for events that there are no triggers for. Previously it received the same events the mod was already
										parsing and ignored the ones with no triggers.
									</li>
									<li>Reduced the amount of information that needs to be passed around to lower memory usage during operation.</li>
								</ul>
							</li>
							<br />

							<li>
								Rewrote the animation code to work using scaled timing. Previously the animation was created by moving the text a set
								amount of pixels each update. This had the effect of causing the animation speed to vary greatly depending on system performance.
								The animations should now keep the same speed regardless of large performance hits, such as those incurred while recording a
								video or during extreme lag.
							</li>
							<li>Each character will now load the last selected profile for that character by default.</li>
							<li>
									Changed the default font to Porky, which has glyphs for most common German, French, and Spanish special characters. In addition, most of the fonts were
									replaced with new versions that support them as well. However, the old Adventure font is still available for those who want to use it.
							</li>
							<li>
								Added an option (enabled by default) to throttle DoTs and HoTs so that only one event for each ability will be displayed within the time period
								specified (2.5 seconds by default). Any additional DoT/HoT abilities that occur while being throttled are merged into one event to be shown once the throttle
								period has passed. This will reduce the spam when you have HoTs and/or DoTs on multiple targets.
							</li>
							<li>Made scroll areas dynamically creatable and made events/triggers assignable to them.</li>
							<li>
								Ability/Spell damage amounts now use a custom color according to their damage type by default. The rest of the message will still show up with the event's selected color.
								This behavior can be disabled.
							</li>
							<li>Partial effects (absorbs, resists, glancing, crushing, overheals, etc) can now be individually enabled, disabled, and color coded.</li>
							<li>Separated Debuff and Item Buff Fades from Buff Fades into new notification events. Totem buffs are now also handled as buff gains and fades.</li>
							<li>Added an Extra Attacks notification event which will give notifications for Windfury, Thrash, Sword Spec, etc.</li>
							<li>Added a Soul Shard Created notification event.</li>
							<li>Overhauled the interface to include the new features.</li>
							<li>Added a font registration function so other mod developers can choose to display their custom messages in their own font.</li>
							<li>Added an animation style registration function so other mod developers can easily provide custom animation styles for MSBT.</li>
							<li>
								Provided an additional file named API.html that is a reference for the publicly accessible functions that
								other mod developers can use to display messages through MSBT and register custom animation styles.

								Made significant changes to the scroll area settings interface. The new interface shows all three
								scroll areas at the same time. Each scroll area is now titled with its coordinates and there are
								editboxes to enter specific coordinates in addition to being able to drag the scroll areas around.
							</li>
							<li>
								Changed the core animation routines to use function pointers in order to eliminate the need for a
								ton of conditional testing. Previously, every time the animation routine was called (typically
								60-70 times per second for every scrolling item), the animation style and scroll direction were
								checked to calculate how to move the text. Now those items are only checked during the initial
								animation object setup phase. This should help performance on slower PCs.
							</li>
							<li>Added the command "/msbt search pattern" to enable an event searching mode which helps identify event types used in the trigger system. See documentation above for more info.</li>

								Moved the Low Health, Low Mana, and Execute events into the trigger system. Due to this change
								the Low Mana and Execute triggers will no longer waste resources checking on classes that don't
								use mana or have an execute ability. Also moving them into the trigger system made the thresholds
								at which to show the Low Health, and Low Mana warnings selectable.

								MAJOR optimization code rewrite:

										Load up KiB Usage in v1.03 was approximately 1050 KiB. This has been reduced to around
